To push to a GitHub repository using a Personal Access Token (PAT) in the command-line interface (CLI), follow these steps:

### 1. Generate a Personal Access Token (PAT)
1. Go to your GitHub account.
2. Navigate to **Settings** > **Developer Settings** > **Personal Access Tokens** > **Tokens (classic)**.
3. Click **Generate new token**.
4. Select the scopes you need for the token (e.g., `repo` for repository access).
5. Generate the token and copy it. This token will be used in place of your password.

### 2. Use the PAT in Git CLI
If you already have a local Git repository set up, proceed as follows:

#### Clone the repository (if not already cloned)
```bash
git clone https://github.com/USERNAME/REPOSITORY.git
```

#### Configure remote URL with the PAT
You can include the PAT directly in the remote URL:

```bash
git remote set-url origin https://<PAT>@github.com/USERNAME/REPOSITORY.git
```

Replace `<PAT>` with your actual token, `USERNAME` with your GitHub username, and `REPOSITORY` with the repository name.

#### Push changes
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Your commit message"
git push origin main
```
Replace `main` with the branch name if itâ€™s different.

### 3. Securely Save Your PAT
It's better to avoid exposing your token in the terminal for security. Instead, use a credential helper:

#### On macOS:
```bash
git config --global credential.helper osxkeychain
```

#### On Linux:
```bash
git config --global credential.helper store
```

#### On Windows:
```bash
git config --global credential.helper wincred
```

Once configured, Git will prompt you to enter your username and PAT (instead of a password) the next time you push. It will store the credentials securely for future use.
